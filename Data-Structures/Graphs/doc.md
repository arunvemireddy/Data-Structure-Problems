# Graphs
A Graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and E as edges.
G(V,E)
where V is a set of vertices: {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5}
And E is Edges which can be of two type: ordered or unordered

### Ordered Edges
Ordered Edges are represented by "()" brackets and it means (a,b) != (b,a)
### Unordered Edges
Unordered Edges are represted by "{}" brackets and it means {a,b} == {b,a}

## Types of Graphs
* Directed Graph
* Undirected Graph
* Weighted Graph

## Properties
* self-loop  : when a vertix have an edge such that E = (x,x). In other words where origin and destinations are same.
* Multi-Edge: More then 1 edges between two vertices. Ex: There can be multiple flights from indore to mumbai.

## Formuls
* In an directed graph with N verticies there can be N*(N-1) Edges
* Where as in undirected graph there will be (N*(N-1))/2 Edges

## Graph Representation
* Adjacency Matrix
* Adjacency List
* Adjacency Sets

## Applications of Graphs
* Transport Networks: Highways Networks, Flight Networks.
* Computer Networks: LAN, Internet, Web 
* Database: For representing ER Diagrams.
